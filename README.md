# Snake

This is a project to re-create the classic game snake using the [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) library. 

The project is not currently fully functional and is mainly intended as an exercise to learn C and C++.

## Currently functional

- Moving snake
- Score system
- Increasing speed based on score
- Keyboard controls
- Food, which makes the snake grow

## Currently unimplemented

- Window resizing
- Game over conditions
- Going off of the screen (looping / ending game)
- Varied difficulties
